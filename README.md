## News

This repository and website has been superseded by [Video Hub App Gatsby Website](https://github.com/whyboris/video-hub-app-gatsby-website)

## This repository

This is a repository just to keep a safe copy of the current public website.

It uses [Sergey](https://github.com/trys/sergey) for static HTML generation using its simple approach to templating.

Just `npm install` and `npm start` to compile the `/public` directory :tada:
